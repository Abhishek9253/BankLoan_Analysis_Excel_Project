## Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to bank loan data using a dataset containing information about loan applications, funding amounts, interest rates, and other loan characteristics. The goal is to provide insights into the bank's loan operations and financial performance by:

### Data Analysis:
Analyze the loan dataset to extract key insights about loan applications, approval rates, funding amounts, and various loan attributes such as interest rates, loan types, and repayment terms.

### Dashboard Creation:
Develop an interactive and visually appealing dashboard in Excel to display essential KPIs, including:
**Total Loan Applications:** Number of loan applications received over a specified period.
**Total Funded Amount:** Total amount of loans approved and disbursed.
**Total Amount Received:** Total amount collected from loan repayments.
**Average Interest Rate:** The mean interest rate across all loans.
**Average Debt-to-Income (DMI) Ratio:** The average DTI ratio of loan applicants.


### Insight Generation:
Provide actionable insights from the data to support business decisions and strategies for improving loan approval processes, risk management, and customer outreach.

### Visualization and Reporting:
Present the data using dynamic charts, tables, and graphs within the Excel dashboard to allow stakeholders to quickly interpret the data and track performance over time.
By the end of the project, the dashboard will serve as a comprehensive tool for monitoring the bankâ€™s loan performance and making data-driven decisions.
